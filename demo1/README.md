How to use:

```
conda activate NeuronMotif

sh script.sh
```

Result are stored in layer1/ and layer2/

There are three filters in layer 1 and one filter in layer 2.
Between these two convolutional layer, there is a max-pooling operation.
Hence, three patterns are generated in layer1/ for three filters and 2 patterns decoupled patterns are generated in layer2/ for one filter.
